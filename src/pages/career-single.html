                <p>
                  We are looking for a personal financial planning pro
                  (Certified Financial Planner™ preferred) who will lead our
                  client advising efforts. You will be a fiduciary who works
                  with clients providing holistic advice on areas including:
                  saving, retirement, debt management, investments. You’ll be on
                  the front lines helping clients in what is arguably the most
                  important position at the company.
                </p>
                <h4>About you</h4>
                <p>
                  We are especially interested in finding developers with
                  experience either building web APIs with Go or experience with
                  functional programming (e.g. Elixir, NodeJS, Clojure, F#). You
                  might not have experience with all the technologies in our
                  stack, but you are motivated to learn deeply. You will get the
                  opportunity to work with both Go and Elixir with experienced
                  team mates who can teach and pair with you to learn whatever
                  you have less experience with.You care about security, code
                  quality, scalability, performance, and simplicity. Above all,
                  you seek operational excellence and apply the best engineering
                  practices possible. Not everything that you or your team do
                  can be perfect, but you make sure that you always know the
                  trade-offs.
